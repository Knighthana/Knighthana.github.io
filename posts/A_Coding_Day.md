First Day! My Blog
===================

  With the help of the Jekyll team and lizer's easy-using website, I finally built up my own blog. However, apparently, it's crude,  very crude.
  I can't wait to set down something I met these days.
  
  Windows in Ubuntu
  -----------------
  
  There is an uncertain reason that the Virtual-Box downloaded by apt can't work well on that HP-Elite laptop with Ubuntu. Each time I open the VirtualBox, there'll be an warning that it can't read the virtual disk. I tried to switch the virtual disk mode to static, failed again. At first I thought it was because of the Inter Rapid Storage Technology. But before I reboot the equipment, an idea came up. I went to the Oracle official website and downloaded an deb package. apt remove, dpkg -i ... Finally, a Windows7 was installed.
  Hard to think about the strange questions.
  
  Coding for physic experiment
  ----------------------------
  
  After drawing the charts with QtiPlot for my physic experiment, Looking at the charts, I know there is something wrong.
  What's wrong?
  There're bad values should have been expeled. Drawing is just to be acquaintant with the new toy QtiPlot. I, still, need to code. I wish I know how to do it on Python, but I am not acquatant with Python. Using C may be a good idea.
  While I was coding, the twenty-forth day of March has gone.
  Pen should be put down. I need to continue my coding.Though it's very early a morning.
