### Windows Type Writing About Desktop Setting ###
{Windows 10}

Today the typewriting program came to taskbar and do not stay at the notify area.

Searched on web, only to find a way about control panel, but the option has not exist anymore.

(To M$ : What the F difference between control panel and settings?

Finally, the step is:

1.Settings ;
2.Language ;
3.Spelling, typing and keyboard settings ;
4.Input ;
5.Advanced Settings ;
6.*Use desktop Language bar (if available)* : Tick it or not ;

Emmmmmm, the Windows 10 settings are too complex and confusing(but the search fountion is so good).
